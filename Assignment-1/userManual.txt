-> User guide for task1shell27502333.c

    Note: - This program is a non-graphical shell where the user will need to type in commands in the terminal to exploit the various
            functionalities mentioned below.

    1. How to compile the ".c" file
        
       a) Open your terminal
       b) Then go to the directory where the file "task1shell27502333.c" is located.
       c) type "gcc task1shell27502333.c" in the terminal.
       d) This will produce a "a.out" file (executable) in the same directory where "task1shell27502333.c" is located.

    2. How to execute the executable file produced after compiling the ".c" file

       a) after compiling the "task1shell27502333.c" file as shown in the previous step, type "./a.out" to 
          execute the executable file "a.out".

    3. Functionalities available for the user

        I) Change directory
            
            --- type "d:NameOfDirectory" inside terminal.

        II) Execute an executable file 

            --- type "x:NameOfExecutable" inside terminal

        III) Display the contents of text file

            --- type "v:NameOfTextFile" inside terminal

        IV) Quit

            --- type "q:" to quit the program.


    4. Assumptions made

        a) If commands the user types in does not start with "d" or "x" or "v" or "q", the command of the user is just skipped.
        b) User is not interested in seeing hidden files. So all hidden files in a directory are skipped and not displayed.

        III) Text file cannot be read due to not having permissions
        IV) Directory cannot be opened due to not having permissions
        VII) Text file is too large to be displayed. (>500 kb)
